- Find the list of users

cat /etc/passwd

- We found user (flag00), so we need to search for his files

find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null

- We found 2 files with the same content

cat /usr/sbin/john => cdiiddwpgswtgt
cat /rofs/usr/sbin/john => cdiiddwpgswtgt

- We tried with this password to login but we failed, so we need to try with decrypt it 
with (https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) we got a list of decoded strings:

we chose the first one (nottoohardhere) and it worked.

- We logged to the flag00 user and we got the flag.
