- When we search in the etc/passwd file we found that the  flag01 user has a hashed password

flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

- To crack this password we used “John the Ripper” password cracker tool in a VM.

- We created a file in the vm with this line 

flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

- We run john and show the cracked password:

john --show passwd.txt => flag01:abcdefg:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

- We got the password: abcdefg, and we use it to login into flag01

- We got the flag.
