- We found a file with this name and extension: level02.pcap

- We search about this type of file and we found that is mainly associated with Wireshark.

- To read this file we installed Wireshark (the world's foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer)

- After install we open the file and we got the logs of connections.

- We choose the first packet and a follow the TCP stream.

- We got a stream content contains a password but in ascii format.

ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L

- So we convert it to UTF-8 and we got the password, and we use it to login into flag02

ft_wandrNDRelL0L

- We got the flag.
