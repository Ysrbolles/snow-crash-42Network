- When we entered to the level03 user, we found a executable file (level03).

- After exec this executable we got => “exploit me”.

- after get some infos with “ltrace level03” cmd:

    "__libc_start_main(0x80484a4, 1, 0xbffff7a4, 0x8048510, 0x8048580 <unfinished ...>
    getegid()                                             = 2003
    geteuid()                                             = 2003
    setresgid(2003, 2003, 2003, 0xb7e5ee55, 0xb7fed280)   = 0
    setresuid(2003, 2003, 2003, 0xb7e5ee55, 0xb7fed280)   = 0
    system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"Check flag.Here is your token :
    Nope there is no token here for you sorry. Try again :)
    <unfinished ...>
    --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
    <... system resumed> )                                = 0
    +++ exited (status 0) +++"
- We found that the program is running the echo command with system func

- So we created a executable file in /tmp with echo name and this file execute a “getflag” cmd,
  and added the /tmp folder to path environment variable.

- We launch the level03 executable again, and we got the flag
