- When we entered to level04 user, we found a file (level04.pl) with perl programming language

- After we cat the file we found that the program launch a website on localhost with port : 4747

- this website parse the query string params from url and print it with echo 

- the param name in the query string is “x”

- So we tried with a simple example like : 
    
    "localhost:4747/?x=ayoub" and we got => ayoub.

- So we tired to inject the getflag cmd with curl => curl 'localhost:4747/?x=$(getflag)'

- And we got the flag
