- When we entered to level05 user, we didn’t found any file this time 


- We didn’t found any file this time, but we searched about all file that owned by flag05, 
and we found 2 files, we can read one of them.

- This one wrote with sh scripting, and this script executes all file in /opt/openarenaserver and delete them.

- We created a file that execute getflag cmd and print it in /tmp/flag

- but we don’t have also the permission to execute the script in /usr/sbin/openarenaserver

- By accident we noticed that the file we created is deleted from that folder

- We concluded that there is a cron tab that launch the script

- And we got the flag in /tmp/flag
