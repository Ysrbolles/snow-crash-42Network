- When we entered to level06 user, We found 2 files level06 and level06.php

- After read the php file and exec the executable file, we noticed that program take a file as argument and use 
  some regex expressions on file content

- The regex use the preg_replce func with /e modifier allows you to use PHP code within your regular expression

- This is means that whatever you parse in will be evaluated as a part of your program

- So we created a file /tmp/test with this content: [x {${shell_exec(getflag)}}]']

- And after execute the file with ./level06 /tmp/test, We got the flag
