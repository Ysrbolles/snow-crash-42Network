- When we entered to level09 user, we found 2 files level09: executable file, token: data file.

- We executed the file and we got a msg (You need to provide only one arg)

- we add token as argument and we got a hashed text format, so we tested with a lot of cases like 
    
    a, ab, abc, 1, 111, 123...)

- We noticed that the program hash with a method of adding the case index to every char.

- When we check ltrace ./level09 we got the trace with this line 
    (puts("You should not reverse this"...)

- We made a C program that do the reverse login of the code(decrease the case index to every char).

- We tested with the token file by (./a.out $(cat token))

- We got a password that will help us to log in to flag09 user.

- We launch getflag cmd, and we got the flag
