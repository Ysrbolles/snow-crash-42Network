- When we entered to level11 user, we found a file with (.lua) extension 
  and it is a code writing by lua programming language.

- We read the code we conclude that it open a connection on localhost in port 5151. and it receive a password

    client:send("Password: ")


- The program hash that password with sha1sum and compare it to a hash.

- It use io.popen function, and this func allows you to executes a command,
  it used to echo the password with sha1sum hashing


- We exploited this function to execute the getflag command by:

    ($(getflag) > /tmp/test)


- We read /tmp/test file we got the flag.
