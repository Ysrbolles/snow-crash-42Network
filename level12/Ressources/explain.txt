- When we entered to level12 user, we found a file written with perl.

- This file host a web server and take 2 params (x, y).

- We found that the program convert the param to uppercase and it execute a command that took the x param

- We think to inject a getflag inside this command

- We create a file /tmp/AYOUB with this test:

 “getflag > /tmp/flag”, and we curl this site: curl '${IP}?x=$(/*/AYOUB)'

- We got the flag in /tmp/flag.
