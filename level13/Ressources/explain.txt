- When we entered to level13 user, we found a binary file level13

- After execution we got this message (UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242)

- We understood that we should give the program a uid with 4242 number

- After did a trace with ltrace we found that it uses the getuid func to get the uid of current user,
  exactly as the program said our uid is 2013.

- We searched about how we can change 
the value returning from getuid func

- The best way to do that is to use gdb (GNU debugger), that help us debug the program and 
  follow step by step and change thier value.

- We launched the program with gdb (gdb level13) and break to getuid func (break getuid)

- We started the execution of program by (run)

- We print the value $eax (which is a processor register variable that getuid func use it to store data)

    we got $eax = 1 => is the default value in start

- We started debugging the func with (step), and after we printed the value 

    we got $eax = 2013 => this is our uid

- We changed the value of this register to 4242 with (set $eax = 4242)

     we print it again and we got 4242
    
- We continue the execution by (c)
   
- Finally we got the flag
