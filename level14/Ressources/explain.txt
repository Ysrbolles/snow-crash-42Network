- In this level, when we entred to level14 user we didn't found any file or something that will help us.

- We tested to launch the getflag command directly and it didn't work.

- We tried to reverse the program by change the uid from our uid to the flag14 uid.

- The best way to do that is to use gdb (GNU debugger), that help us debug the program and 
  follow step by step and change thier value.

- But this time we got a msg (You should not reverse this).
  ==> So we think that there is something that block us to debug the program.

- After did a trace with ltrace we found that it uses the ptrace func that detect if we are using a debbuger (GDB).

- The ptrace func returns (-1), in case of error, so we tried to chnage its return value from -1 to 0.

- We launched the program with gdb (gdb level14) and break to ptrace func (break ptrace)

(gdb) print $eax // = 0
(gdb) step
(gdb) print $eax // = -1
(gdb) set $eax = 0 // = 0

- Now we are good with ptarce, and we chnage the getuid return to the flag14 uid

(gdb) print $eax // = 32
(gdb) step
(gdb) print $eax // = 2014
(gdb) set $eax = 3014 // = 3014

- We continue the execution by (c)
   
- Finally we got the flag
